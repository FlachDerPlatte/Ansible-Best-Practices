# Tasks

## Always *name* tasks
It is possible to leave off the *name* for a given task, though it is recommended to provide a description about why something is being done instead. This description is shown when the playbook is run.

=== "Good"
    !!! success ""
        ```yaml
        - name: Install webserver package
          ansible.builtin.yum:
            name: httpd
            state: present
        ```
=== "Bad"
    !!! failure ""
        ```yaml
        - yum:
            name: httpd
            state: present
        ```

## Always mention the *state*
The `state` parameter is optional to a lot of modules. Whether `state: present` or `state: absent`, itâ€™s always best to leave that parameter in your playbooks to make it clear, especially as some modules support additional states.
